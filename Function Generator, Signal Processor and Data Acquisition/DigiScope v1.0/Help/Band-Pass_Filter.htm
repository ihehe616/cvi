<P>A <B>band-pass filter</B> is a device that passes <A title=Frequency 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency">frequencies</A> within a certain 
range and rejects (<A class=mw-redirect title=Attenuate 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuate">attenuates</A>) frequencies 
outside that range. An example of an <A class=mw-redirect title="Analog circuit" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_circuit">analogue</A> electronic 
band-pass <A title="Filter (signal processing)"

title="Electrical network"

filters can also be created by combining a <A title="Low-pass filter" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter">low-pass filter</A> with a 
<A title="High-pass filter"

<P><I>Bandpass</I> is an adjective that describes a type of filter or filtering 
process; it is frequently confused with <A title=Passband 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passband">passband</A>, which refers to the 
actual portion of affected spectrum. Hence, one might say "A dual bandpass 
filter has two passbands." A <I>bandpass signal</I> is a signal containing a 
band of frequencies away from zero frequency, such as a signal that comes out of 
a bandpass filter.<SUP class=reference id=cite_ref-1><A 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-pass_filter#cite_note-1"><SPAN>[</SPAN>2<SPAN>]</SPAN></A></SUP></P>
<P>An ideal bandpass filter would have a completely flat <A title=Passband 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passband">passband</A> (e.g. with no 
gain/attenuation throughout) and would completely attenuate all frequencies 
outside the passband. Additionally, the transition out of the passband would be 
instantaneous in frequency. In practice, no bandpass filter is ideal. The filter 
does not attenuate all frequencies outside the desired frequency range 
completely; in particular, there is a region just outside the intended passband 
where frequencies are attenuated, but not rejected. This is known as the filter 
<A title=Roll-off href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-off">roll-off</A>, and 
it is usually expressed in <A title=Decibel 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">dB</A> of attenuation per <A 
title="Octave (electronics)" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_%28electronics%29">octave</A> or <A 
title="Decade (log scale)" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_%28log_scale%29">decade</A> of 
frequency. Generally, the design of a filter seeks to make the roll-off as 
narrow as possible, thus allowing the filter to perform as close as possible to 
its intended design. Often, this is achieved at the expense of pass-band or 
stop-band <I>ripple</I>.</P>
<P>The <A title="Bandwidth (signal processing)" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_%28signal_processing%29">bandwidth</A> 
of the filter is simply the difference between the upper and lower <A 
title="Cutoff frequency" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_frequency">cutoff frequencies</A>. The 
shape factor is the ratio of bandwidths measured using two different attenuation 
values to determine the cutoff frequency, e.g., a shape factor of 2:1 at 30/3 dB 
means the bandwidth measured between frequencies at 30 dB attenuation is twice 
that measured between frequencies at 3 dB attenuation.</P>
<P>Outside of electronics and signal processing, one example of the use of 
band-pass filters is in the <A title="Atmospheric sciences" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_sciences">atmospheric 
sciences</A>. It is common to band-pass filter recent meteorological data with a 
<A title="Periodic function" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function">period</A> range of, for 
example, 3 to 10 days, so that only <A title=Cyclone 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone">cyclones</A> remain as fluctuations 
in the data fields.</P>
