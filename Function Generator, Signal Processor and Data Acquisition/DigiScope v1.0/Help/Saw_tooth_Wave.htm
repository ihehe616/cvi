<P>The <B>sawtooth wave</B> (or <B>saw wave</B>) is a kind of <A 
title="Non-sinusoidal waveform" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-sinusoidal_waveform">non-sinusoidal 
waveform</A>. It is named a sawtooth based on its resemblance to the teeth on 
the blade of a <A title=Saw href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw">saw</A>.</P>
<P>The convention is that a sawtooth wave ramps upward and then sharply drops. 
However, there are also sawtooth waves in which the wave ramps downward and then 
sharply rises. The latter type of sawtooth wave is called a "reverse sawtooth 
wave" or "inverse sawtooth wave".</P>

<P>A sawtooth wave's sound is harsh and clear and its 
spectrum contains both even and odd <A title=Harmonic

title="Fundamental frequency" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency">fundamental 
frequency</A>. Because it contains all the integer harmonics, it is one of the 
best waveforms to use for synthesizing musical sounds, particularly bowed string 
instruments like violins and cellos, using <A title="Subtractive synthesis"

  <LI>Sawtooth waves are perhaps best known for their use in music. The sawtooth 
  and square waves are the most common starting points used to create sounds 
  with subtractive <A title="Subtractive synthesis" 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_synthesis">analog</A> and <A 
  class=mw-redirect title="Virtual analog" 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_analog">virtual analog</A> music 
  synthesizers.</LI>
  <LI>The sawtooth wave is the form of the vertical and horizontal <A 
  title=Deflection href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflection">deflection</A> 
  signals used to generate a <A title="Raster graphics" 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics">raster</A> on <A 
  title="Cathode ray tube" 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube">CRT</A>-based television 
  or monitor screens. <A title=Oscilloscope 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope">Oscilloscopes</A> also use a 
  sawtooth wave for their horizontal deflection, though they typically use <A 
  class=mw-redirect title=Electrostatic 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic">electrostatic</A> 
  deflection. 
  <UL>
    <LI>On the wave's "ramp", the magnetic field produced by the <A class=new 
    title="Deflection yoke (page does not exist)" 
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deflection_yoke&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">deflection 
    yoke</A> drags the <A title=Electron 
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron">electron</A> beam across the 
    face of the CRT, creating a <A title="Scan line" 
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_line">scan line</A>.</LI>
    <LI>On the wave's "cliff", the magnetic field suddenly collapses, causing 
    the electron beam to return to its resting position as quickly as 
    possible.</LI>
    <LI>The voltage applied to the deflection yoke is adjusted by various means 
    (transformers, capacitors, center-tapped windings) so that the half-way 
    voltage on the sawtooth's cliff is at the zero mark, meaning that a negative 
    voltage will cause deflection in one direction, and a positive voltage 
    deflection in the other; thus, a center-mounted deflection yoke can use the 
    whole screen area to depict a trace. Frequency is 15.734&nbsp;kHz on <A 
    title=NTSC href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC">NTSC</A>, 
    15.625&nbsp;kHz for <A title=PAL 
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL">PAL</A> and <A title=SECAM 
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECAM">SECAM</A>).</LI>
    <LI>The vertical deflection system operates the same way as the horizontal, 
    though at a much lower frequency (59.94&nbsp;Hz on <A title=NTSC 
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC">NTSC</A>, 50&nbsp;Hz for PAL and 
    SECAM).</LI>
    <LI>The ramp portion of the wave must appear as a straight line. If 
    otherwise, it indicates that the voltage isn't increasing linearly, and 
    therefore that the magnetic field produced by the deflection yoke is not 
    linear. As a result, the electron beam will accelerate during the non-linear 
    portions. This would result in a television image "squished" in the 
    direction of the non-linearity. Extreme cases will show marked brightness 
    increases, since the electron beam spends more time on that side of the 
    picture.</LI>
    <LI>The first television receivers had controls allowing users to adjust the 
    picture's vertical or horizontal linearity. Such controls were not present 
    on later sets as the stability of electronic components had 
  improved.</LI></UL></LI></UL></body>
